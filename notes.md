## Regression
>Used to predict a linearly related set of variables
## Models
- Generated using both inputs and outputs to predict possible outcomes for a specific scenarios. Most linear regression problems fit to the equation. y = B0+B1x+e(B0,B1 are constants, e is error)
- Simple linear regression has one independent variable and a dependent variable
- Multiple linear regression has many independent variables.
- Non-linear regression produces a curve not a straight-line.

## Performance measure
- Can use cost functions to find out the performance of a model.

## Regularisation of linear function
- Ridge regression(L2 regression)
- Lasso regression(L1 regression)
- Elastic net regression(L1+L2 regression)
